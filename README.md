#Course Description
Modern phylogenetic comparative methods. Students will learn about major methods of evolutionary analyses using phylogenies. We will discuss how methods work, their pros and cons in implementation, read the literature of methods development and application, and practice using methods on real data. Students will conclude the course with a short project using their own datasets.

In-Class Activities
Students are expected to attend and interact during course meetings. Participation in this course is a graded component.

Mondays: Lecture session. We will discuss the mechanisms of macroevolutionary modeling.
Wednesdays: Paper discussion. We will discuss (1) Methods paper for developing a model and (2) a recent paper that implemented it.
Fridays: R laboratory. We will learn to fit macroevolutionary models in R.


Course Policies
Technology and AI
Please respect my time and submit your own thoughts. ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence tools are not permitted in this course. Any use of AI tools may result in a 0 on the appropriate assignment, quiz, and/or on the course final grade. 

Late Work Policy
Extensions are available on a case-by-case basis. However, they must be requested from the instructor prior to the assignment deadline. No extensions are available after the assignment deadline. With no extension, 5% will be reduced from the assignment’s score per 24 hours late.
  
Attendance and Make-Up Policy 
Students should make all reasonable efforts to attend all class meetings. You are expected to participate in all discussions, have completed all readings before class, and to fully engage with the material and your classmates. However, in the event a student is unable to attend a class, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor as soon as possible and make up class work missed within a reasonable amount of time. Missing class meetings may result in reducing the overall grade in the class due to a reduced participation score. Any relevant recordings, slides, and relevant notes will be available on Canvas.

Academic Integrity Statement
Academic integrity is the foundation of learning. You are responsible for reading WSU's Academic Integrity Policy, which is based on Washington State law. If you cheat in your work in this class you will:
•	Receive a 0 on the appropriate assignment, quiz, presentation, or overall grade in the class.
•	Be reported to the Center for Community Standards
•	Have the right to appeal my decision
•	Not be able to drop the course of withdraw from the course until the appeals process is finished
If you have any questions about what you can and cannot do in this course, ask me.
If you want to ask for a change in my decision about academic integrity, use the form at the Center for Community Standards website. You must submit this request within 21 calendar days of the decision.

Expectations for Student Effort & Classroom Decorum 
For each hour of lecture equivalent, students should expect to have a minimum of two hours of work outside of class.
 
In support of fruitful and open academic discourse, we are all are expected to engage in courteous, civil, and mutually respectful exchanges focused on and relevant to the course materials. Students should not engage in disruptive behavior which obstructs or disrupts the learning environment, including, but not limited to, dominating the classroom or online discussion, behavior that disrupts the flow of instruction, or failure to cooperate in maintaining classroom decorum. Students engaging in behavior that is disruptive to the course objectives may be asked to leave or be referred to the appropriate disciplinary process. I am similarly committed to creating a civil and productive environment for the free exchange of ideas; students who have concerns about this should contact the department chair.
 
University Syllabus
Students are responsible for reading and understanding all university-wide policies and resources pertaining to all courses (for instance: accommodations, care resources, policies on discrimination or harassment), which can be found in the university syllabus.

Services for Students with Disabilities
If you are in need of special accommodations due to a disability, as recognized by the Americans with Disabilities Act, please contact the WSU Access Center to communicate your needed arrangements as soon as possible (https://accesscenter.wsu.edu.).
 
Course Materials 
Readings will be provided as pdfs on the course Canvas page or Dr. Corn’s GitHub repository.

WSU Learning Goal 	WSU Learning Outcome	Course Learning Outcomes	Assessment of the Learning Outcomes
Critical and creative thinking	Conceptualize a substantial, culminating project that requires the application of key concepts, methods, and skills to address authentic situations.	•	Develop and complete a mini project with real data
•	Give a 10-minute presentation to peers that showcases the project and concisely articulates the project's rationale, goals, methods, and outcomes.	•	Final project presentation

Integrative learning	Apply concepts, skills, and/or methods of inquiry within and/or across disciplines to address authentic situations.	•	Integrate the many available phylogenetic comparative methods to ask and answer evolutionary questions.
	•	R laboratory implementation
Information literacy	Identify and synthesize multiple relevant bodies of knowledge and sources of information to support findings or results within the context of an authentic situation.	•	Connect strengths and weaknesses of methods to a holistic understanding of evolutionary process.
•	Attribute ideas appropriately.	•	Weekly paper discussion
